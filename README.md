# Character Information Context

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This project has been discontinued

> [!WARNING]
> This project is still experimental, this project can be lost or archive, not really fixed, which is not offical from ChatGPT's request, but only makes it easier to customize it

A place like a wiki or data from the character for the context of the response that will be made by the AI to create a custom instruction on ChatGPT which will respond like a character in general in the story of the character.

## Can we make it

Sure, everyone has the right to create, modify and delete, but only if it is not related to malicious content, or outside of a character making an inappropriate response.

## How to help?

You can follow the method here, [please read it first.](./build-data-char.md)
