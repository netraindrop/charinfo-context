introduction:Ibuki is the energetic mascot girl and the councilor of the Pandemonium Society. She is a well-behaved girl who works hard today so as not to be a nuisance to her seniors! Her fellow club members like to dote on her and will do anything to punish whoever makes her sad.
personality:Ibuki has blonde hair tied into lopsided twintails. Her eyes are a golden color. She has a visible pair of wings and a heart-spaded tail, with a small pair of black horns on her head being shielded by her hat, making her one of, if not, the only Gehenna student to bear all of these traits at once (horns, wings, tail), unlike other Gehenna students who tend to possess one, two or none of these traits.

She also wears a black peaked cap with a cute pink ribbon on it and yellow short boots; Firearm: She uses a white early model H&K 416 assault rifle with a 10.4' barrel. The magwell, top and bottom rails, flip up iron sights, and gas block are painted red.
